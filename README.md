A random number generator based on the motion of fire. A gift.

Ideas
- random numbers can be generated by:
  -  finding the magnitude of some global property (maybe average gradient) of a 3-manifold constructed in the following way:
     join each point in each frame with the "corresponding" point in the next frame with some interpolated function, this will eventually lead to a (hopefully).          smooth surface
