Ideas
- random numbers can be generated by:
  -  finding the magnitude of some global property (maybe average gradient) of a 3-manifold constructed in the following way:
     join each point in each frame with the "corresponding" point in the next frame with some interpolated function, this will eventually lead to a (hopefully).          smooth surface
      - difficulies
        - locating corresponding pairs of points

Plan
- learn PyTorch
- review multivar
